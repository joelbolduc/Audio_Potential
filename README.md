# Audio_Potential
Amplifies soft music files to their full audio potential by normalizing the amplitude of the sound wave over the signal with minimal distortion and/or clipping.
Only mono wav files are currently supported (stereo files will generate an error).
Support for stereo files will be added shortly.
