# Audio_Potential
Amplifies soft music files to their full audio potential by normalizing the amplitude of the sound wave over the signal with minimal distortion and/or clipping.
Only mono wav files are currently supported (stereo files will generate an error).
To use, open Normalizer in your favorite python editor, and execute the script.
Make sure your .wav file is in the same directory.
Instruction will be prompted on the console, to normalize your file.
Normalized file will be generated with 'optimized' added to the file name.
